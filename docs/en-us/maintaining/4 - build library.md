# Build and push library to npm (or patch)

This should be run to build and push all libraries to npm.

```
npm run xr publish-libs
```

> ⚠️⚠️ OTP is not currently supported

Similarly, this must be run to be able to work with another project without pushing it to NPM

```
npm run xr patch-libs ../another_project/node_modules
```

When publishing to NPM Registry, the information in the `"version": "..."` or `"iksir": {...}` block in the root directory `package.json` is used.

This command will do the things following:

- It performs precompilation with the `tsconfig.lib-publish.json` file with the help of `tsc`.

- According to the imports made, the versions of the packages are taken from the `package.json` in the root directory and peerDependencies are placed in the package.json of the library to be sent.

- The library that imported the least is re-ordered according to the number of libraries that imported the most.

- In this cycle, a library takes the imported project library into itself. In this process, different processes take place according to the imported library mode.

- `PEER`: As the version of the project in the root directory, it is added to the `package.json` file of the library to be published as a Peer dependency.

- `EMBEDDED`: The `_monaembed` folder is created in the build and the name of the imported library is changed according to whatever it is. For example; if the library name is `@ubs-platform/users-consts`, it will be converted to `./_monaembed/@ubs-platform/users-consts` or `../../_monaembed/@ubs-platform/users-consts` depending on the current file location

- package.json is written into build directory
- NPM is sent to the Registry or copied to the specified folder if in `patch` mode.

## Additional notes that may be important

If the `dist/library` folder looks like this when you build with tsc.

```
-users-microservice-helper
---microservice-setup-util
---users-common
---users-consts
---users-microservice-helper
------src
---------index.js
```

In this case, the `package.json` in the library should be edited accordingly.

```
"iksir": {
        "type": "LIBRARY",
        "libraryMode": "PEER",
        "buildSubFolder": "users-microservice-helper/src"
    },
```
